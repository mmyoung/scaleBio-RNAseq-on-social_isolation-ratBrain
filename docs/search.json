    "text": "Rationale\n\nSince the barcode detection step in scaleBio pipeline disgards many reads in our recent run, the details of bc_parser tools developed by scaleBio is not open. So I’m trying to write my own barcode extraction and correction tool.\nWhen the sequencing cycle of R2 is long enough to reach cDNA, the scaleBio pipeline will waste the cDNA sequences pass the polyT, so I’m trying to keep that part of reads and use for mapping"
