# ScaleBio run on rat brain tissues from social isolation study
Lin Yang

## Project description
Three replicates for female and male rat treated with social isolation and social grouped respectively are included in the experiment. The treatment was exerted from p41-p55. Then, orbitofrontal cortex are dissected from frozen brain tissues and Hang did the nuclei preparation and library preparation with ScaleBio RNA-seq kit.

A relavant presentation for this project is available at: [presentation](https://uchicago.box.com/s/o20tc5qjuk0ekn20dbln4atk9shx8sb1)

## Data processing steps
1. data preprocess

The library sequencing was ran on Illumina sequencer and demultiplexed by i5 barcode by the sequencing core in UofC.
Four .fastq files are returned from the core: 

*Undetermined_S0_L002_I1_001.fastq.gz: i7 index
*Undetermined_S0_L002_I2_001.fastq.gz: i5 index
*Undetermined_S0_L002_R1_001.fastq.gz: reads1, recording barcode sequences
*Undetermined_S0_L002_R2_001.fastq.gz: reads2, recording cDNA sequences

The data preprocessing are implemented with pipeline from ScaleBio with the command:

```
module load singularity
nextflow run /project/zhuzhuzhang/lyang/software/ScaleRna/ -params-file runParams.yml -profile singularity --outDir /project/zhuzhuzhang/lyang/scaleBio_RNA_rat_brain/out_mRatBN â€”-splitFastq true
```

**inputs:**
[runParams.yml](../script/runParams.yml)

**outputs:**

quality control (/project/zhuzhuzhang/lyang/scaleBio_RNA_rat_brain/out_mRatBN/samples)

cell by feature matrix (/project/zhuzhuzhang/lyang/scaleBio_RNA_rat_brain/out_mRatBN/alignment)

2. cell clustering

[Cell clustering was perform in R with Seurat package](cell_clustering.html)
