## Goals
1. develop barcode correction and demultiplexing method for sci-RNA-seq, further optimize the whole pipeline
2. if the R2 reads pass the polyT tail reaching cDNA sequences, after polyT removal in R2 reads, keep the cDNA sequences for mapping

## Rationale
1. Since the barcode detection step in scaleBio pipeline disgards many reads in our recent run, the details of bc_parser tools developed by scaleBio is not open. So I'm trying to write my own barcode extraction and correction tool.
2. When the sequencing cycle of R2 is long enough to reach cDNA, the scaleBio pipeline will waste the cDNA sequences pass the polyT, so I'm trying to keep that part of reads and use for mapping

## Primary exploration
1. What's the off
